# loot-rarity

Get the rarity level of a Loot ([lootproject.com](https://lootproject.com)) item.

## How does it work?

- Items with 300 or more occurences have a rarity of 1 (common).
- Items between 50 and 300 occurences have a rarity of 2 (uncommon).
- Items between 25 and 50 occurences have a rarity of 3 (rare).
- Items between 10 and 25 occurences have a rarity of 4 (epic).
- Items between 2 and 10 occurences have a rarity of 5 (legendary).
- Items with a single occurence have a rarity of 6 (mythic).

## Installation

```sh
npm i --save loot-rarity # npm
yarn add loot-rarity # yarn
pnpm add loot-rarity # pnpm
```

## API

```tsx
// Rarity goes from 1 to 6.
type Rarity = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6;

// Get the rarity of an item given its name.
function itemRarity(itemName: string): Rarity;

// Get the color of an item given its name or rarity.
function rarityColor(itemOrRarity: string | Rarity): string;

// Get the description of a rarity given an item name or rarity level.
function rarityDescription(itemOrRarity: string | Rarity): string;
```
